# Sandbox crowdfunding dapp

A sandbox project to try out technologies such as Solidity, Truffle, and Web3.js.

## Scope

The main goal is to create a crowdfunding Solidity smart contract that will allow users to:

1. create funding campaigns (e.g. provide a description, expected amount, ending time)
2. donate to an open campaign
3. withdraw donation
4. close the campaign before the ending time (with a freeze on the funds, in the case some donators change their mind)
5. withdraw the collected donations (also after a specific period of time)

Additionally, I envision creating a minimalistic UI for campaign creators and donators.
